<h3>Business Problem</h3>
<p>
 An automotive company has approached our analytics firm. They are planning to launch two products: a Two-Wheeler and a Four-Wheeler in the market.
 They want us to analyze the market data provided by the market research team and try to deduce some insights based on the following requirements:
 <ol>
   <li>Preferable regions to launch both products 🌏.
   </li>
   <li>Target Customers for each product 🧑👩.
   </li>
   <li>Cost estimation for each product 💵.
   </li>
 </ol>

 Apart from these requirements, if our firm can provide some additional insights or suggestions which may prove vital in the product launch, they can surely do so.
