<h3>Business Problem</h3>
<p>
 An automotive company has approached our analytics firm. They are planning to launch two products: a Two-Wheeler and a Four-Wheeler in the market.
 They want us to analyze the market data provided by the market research team and try to deduce some insights based on the following requirements:
 <ol>
   <li>Preferable regions to launch both products 🌏.
   </li>
   <li>Target Customers for each product 🧑👩.
   </li>
   <li>Cost estimation for each product 💵.
   </li>
 </ol>
 Apart from these requirements, if our firm can provide some additional insights or suggestions which may prove vital in the product launch, they can surely do so.
</p>

<h3>Tech Stack</h3>

 <ol>
  <li>
   Excel: Conditional Statements, Removing Duplicates, Removing Null values
  </li>
  <li>
   Python: SQLAlchemy, Loading Data into MySQL

 <h3>Key Insights</h3>

   🌍: Europe and North America came out as the best markets to launch automotive products due to the large proportion of potential customers within large population.
  </li>
  <li>
   🏍️: People who have short commute distances (0-1 miles) are in their mid-30s and have small family sizes (1 child) tend to buy two-wheelers.
  </li>
  <li>
   🚗: People who have large commute distances ( > 2 miles), are in their mid-40s, and have large family sizes (more than 1 child) tend to buy four-wheelers.
  </li>
  <li>
   💵: Income is also a crucial factor in Europe that affects the decision to buy a two or four-wheeler.
